*X-Mode*

Wrapper around vim's CTRL-X insert mini mode.

The intent is to aid learning the more obscure corners of the mode, as well as
offering more time to invoke them

Core functionality:

    * provide a fuller prompt
    * provide completion help
    * provide indefinite time to complete the mode
